# Security Policy

We appreciate responsible disclosure. Please follow these instructions if you find a security issue.

Reporting a vulnerability
- Preferred: email an encrypted report to security@qwallet.example (replace with a project email or PGP key) including:
  - Affected component and version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Impact assessment and any proof-of-concept
- If email isn't possible, open a private GitHub issue labeled `security` (or contact a maintainer directly).

Response policy
- We will acknowledge receipt within 72 hours.
- We will coordinate on a remediation timeline and release.

Responsible disclosure guidelines
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until a fix and coordinated disclosure are available.
- Provide us time to patch; maintainers may coordinate timelines for disclosure.

Project-specific considerations
- This project references post-quantum algorithms. Use audited and maintained implementations; do not roll your own crypto.
- Avoid storing private keys in plaintext. Prefer OS-provided secure storage or hardware-backed key stores when available.
- Add automated checks (dependency audits, static analysis, fuzzing) in CI for crypto and critical code paths.
